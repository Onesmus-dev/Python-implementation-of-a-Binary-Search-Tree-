# Python Implementation of a Binary Search Tree

This repository contains a Python implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). It includes functionalities such as insertion, in-order traversal, searching, finding the maximum element, and calculating the sum of all elements.

### Contents

- `BinaryTree.py`: Implementation of the `BinarySearchTreeNode` class and related functions.
- `main.py`: Example script demonstrating usage of the BST functionalities.
- `README.md`: Overview of the project, usage instructions, and contributions.

### How to Use

1. **Setup**:
   - Clone the repository:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Onesmus-dev/Python-implementation-of-a-Binary-Search-Tree-.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the directory:
     ```
     cd Python-implementation-of-a-Binary-Search-Tree-
     ```

2. **Run the Example Script**:
   - Execute the example script:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The script demonstrates construction of a BST, in-order traversal, searching, finding the maximum element, and calculating the sum of elements.
